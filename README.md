# phyd3_ex
Example websites built using the PhyD3 library (both using node modules and the GitHub repo code)

## File Descriptions

### ex.html  
This website was built with the instructions on the [PhyD3 website](https://phyd3.bits.vib.be/documentation.html)  

### web.html  
This website was built with the instructions on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vibbits/phyd3/)  

### sample.xml  
This is a very simple example input file  

## Instructions
1. The html files were placed in my copy of the GitHub repo, which is also where I installed the current node modules. So, notice the files have relative path references to my local files, which may need to be changed on your copy.  
2. I ran a local web server to allow the XML files to be read; this can be done in a variety of ways, but I followed these [instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)    

It is possible you will need to install/cleanup references to the package dependencies.
